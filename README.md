# sports_database
Program which populates and allows editing of a sports database

This was the weekend assignment at the end of my third week at the Iron Yard. The purpose of this assignment 
was to gain experience working with psycopg2 and PostgreSQL using Python to manually create and edit a database.

For this assignment I chose a Boston Bruins roster as data. The program populates the database and allows the user to add new players.
